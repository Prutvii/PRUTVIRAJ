# PRUTVIRAJ

Welcome to the PRUTVI project! This project provides a data input and search functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The PRUTVI module allows users to input data and perform search operations on that data. The input form collects information such as name, email, city, state, ID number, category, and social media. Users can submit the form to store the data, and then perform searches based on various search terms. The search results are displayed dynamically on the page.

## Installation

To use the PRUTVI module, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Prutvii/PRUTVI.git
